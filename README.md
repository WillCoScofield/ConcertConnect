# ConcertConnect
Concert Connection is an artist search application with results linking to available tickets, dates, and venue information. It utilizes the Materialize CSS framework, and the afromentioned APIs. The Bands In Town request retrieves data on the artist searched, and then utilizing the lat/long of the concert venue data I created an interactive map for display.
